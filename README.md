# SmartBike
In recent years, the popularity of electric bicycles has transformed the landscape of urban
commuting, offering riders an array of benefits and features. Electric bikes, or e-bikes, have
become synonymous with innovation, leveraging sophisticated systems to monitor, record, and
enhance the overall riding experience. The market for such products has grown significantly,
expected to be worth around $120 billion globally by 2030 [1]. As such, developments in this
field offer much potential for opportunities in creative designs and solutions.
The XF04 project is positioned at the forefront of this evolution, aiming to replicate the
advanced features of modern e-bikes and integrate them seamlessly onto a conventional bicycle.
Central to this endeavor is incorporating systems that encompass the monitoring of various
parameters through sensors, GPS technology, Bluetooth connectivity, phone integration, and
regenerative energy harvesting. By converging these technologies onto a standard bicycle, the
objective is to create a Smart Bike that mirrors the functionalities of its electric counterparts and
enhances the cycling experience by introducing a blend of connectivity, safety, and
environmental consciousness.
Throughout the fall semester, the focus of the project was mostly directed towards the
development of the designs in the project. Different design options were analyzed and preferable
solutions were determined. From the start of the winter semester, the actual manufacturing and
implementation phase of the project was initiated. At the start, a set of milestones was developed
and each had to be met by certain points of the project. At each milestone, the completed progress
was demonstrated to the FLC to ensure that the project was on track and that the required work
was being completed. By the third milestone, the majority of the requirements were functional
with final changes implemented by the last milestone and demonstration.
Work on the project was distributed across the four members of the team. Student A had
The task of working on the energy harvesting system (EHS), Student B worked on the various
sensors and their interfacing to the phone app, Student C implemented the GPS functionality
through a sensor and on the phone app, and Student D implemented the Bluetooth
communication and UI design of the phone app. The clear distribution of responsibilities allowed
for each member to work independently while communicating with the rest of the team on
weekly meetings to determine completed progress, issues, and future steps.
This report will delve into the intricacies of the project, offering insights into the design
choices, methodologies, and the completed product. By aligning the team's efforts with the
transformative trends in urban mobility, the XF04 project endeavors to set new benchmarks in
smart, sustainable transportation.
